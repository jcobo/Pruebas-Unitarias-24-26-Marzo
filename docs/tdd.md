Test-Driven Development:
· Don’t write a line of new code unless you first have a failing automated test.
· Eliminate duplication.

The two rules imply an order to the tasks of programming:
· Red—write a little test that doesn’t work, perhaps doesn’t even compile at first
· Green—make the test work quickly, committing whatever sins necessary in the
process
· Refactor—eliminate all the duplication created in just getting the test to work
Red/green/refactor. The TDDs mantra.
